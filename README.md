# ☕ Tea-rrific Analysis!

I catalogued my entire tea collection — from the basics like name and brand to more nuanced details like type, brew method, steeping temperatures, steeping times, and even weights. This personal dataset serves as both a passion project and a playground for practicing data science workflows.  
> Bonus data: Coffee!  
  
### This project combines:

1. My love for tea 🍵

2. My passion for data analysis 📊

3. The desire to turn a personal hobby into a sharable, reproducible, and fun dataset.

## 📂 Project Overview

This repository documents the journey of turning a slight caffeine addiction into a data project.  

With this dataset, I explored:

- Data cleaning: standardizing categories, handling missing data, and converting text into usable features.

- Exploratory data analysis: uncovering trends in tea preferences, brewing recommendations, and ingredient patterns.

- Visualization: creating charts and plots to see how steep times and water temperatures vary by tea type, brew method, and more.

- Predictive modeling: building models in JMP to predict optimal steeping time and water temperature from tea type.

## 🚀 Future Plans

I’ve split my files into:

1. Collection as of 03-09-2025 → a frozen snapshot for reproducible analysis

2. [Future project] Live collection → a continuously updated version (*currently empty*)

### ***Planned features for the Live Collection App:***

- Input tea and coffee purchases as I buy them

- Automatically update my live dataset

- Track when products are opened and finished

- Generate recommendations based on past brewing preferences

***Potential tech stack & skills to explore:***

- Database design (SQL / NoSQL)

- Data APIs for ingredient or brand lookups

- Interactive visualization dashboards (e.g., brew guides, consumption trends)

- Predictive modeling for brewing suggestions
